# This class contains all functionally to abstract bootstrap's modal and whatever
# other libraries are used for modal windows.
#
# Use the class 'open-modal' in a `<a>` tag to open its content in a modal.
# If the `href` is a link, it will be loaded (ajax) and the content will be rendered
# in the modal. If the `href` points to an id (e.g. #my-element), the element's content
# will be displayed as a modal window.
# To view more options see `mconf.Modal.showWindow()`.
#
# Modals have a default width set by bootstrap. To set a different width, set `data-modal-width`
# in your element. The values accepted are:
# * `small`: Adds a css class to force the modal to be smaller/narrower
#
# Triggers the events:
# * `modal-before-configure`: First event triggered when the modal starts being configured.
# * `modal-open`: From bootstrap, triggered immediately after `show` is called.
# * `modal-opened`: From bootstrap, triggered after the modal is loaded and shown.
# * `modal-hide`: From bootstrap, triggered immediately after `hide` is called.
# * `modal-hidden`: From bootstrap, triggered after the modal is closed.
#
class mconf.Modal

  # Shows the modal window using the options in 'options'
  # Options accepted:
  # * `element`: The element that generated the event (i.e. the link or button that was clicked).
  # * `target`: The target modal that will be opened. Can be a selector to an element already in
  #   the page (e.g. '#my-modal') or a link to a URL that will be loaded to get the modal content.
  # * `data`: Can be used to pass the content that should be shown in the modal via javascript. To
  #   use it, leave `target` as `null` and set `data` with the string containing the HTML to be
  #   shown.
  # * `modalWidth`: To force the modal to assume a different width. Accepted values: "small".
